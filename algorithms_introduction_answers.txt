1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following 
   primitive algorithms:

    Making coffee;
    Washing dishes;
    A choice of your own.

   A: 
    Making coffee;
        First add water to coffee pot
        Add coffee grounds to coffee pot
        Turn on coffee pot
 
    Washing dishes;
        Turn on water
        Add soap to water and fill sink up
        Turn off the water
        Wash the dishes
 
    Brushing Teeth;
         Open toothpaste
         Put toothpaste on toothbrush
         Brush teeth

2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than 
   one way to solve the problem. It is essential to 
   try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. 
   Name three companies who created an algorithm that 
   made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. 
   It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe 
   or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm 
   produces more relevant results than other search 
   engines; what about each of your cases make them 
   stand out?

   A: 

   1. PKWare was founded by Phil Katz in 1986 after he 
      invented the ZIP file compression algorithm. The 
      ZIP file is now completely ubiquitous, being 
      incorporated into every major OS and also into Java.

 
   2. RSA Data Security, founded by the inventors of the 
      RSA public-key encryption algorithms which are used
      widely for securing data transmission.

   3. TrafficCast International was founded on a series of 
      patented mathematical algorithms and methods to 
      continuously calculate traffic networks from tons of 
      data streams.

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm 
   versus an inefficient algorithm.

   A: An efficient algorithm will have a logical order to its
      steps. An inefficient algorithm will not have such a 
      logical order.
