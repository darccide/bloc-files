Short Answers

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

   A: Programmers use pseudocode to explain to other 
      people what a particular program will do. It 
      allows programmers to brainstorm about algorithms
      before they are coded in a particular language.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

   A: If you run pseudocode on your computer it will not run.
      It isn't written in a computer language. It is written
      in a way that is easy for people to understand. A computer
      will not be able to "comprehend" it.

Programming Assignment

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater
   number.

   A: FUNCTION greaterNumber(firstNumber, secondNumber)
        IF the firstNumber is greater than the secondNumber THEN
          PRINT firstNumber
        ELSE IF the secondNumber is greater than the firstNumber THEN
          PRINT secondNumber
        ELSE
          PRINT "These numbers are equal."
        END IF
      END FUNCTION

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

   A: FUNCTION oneToHundred()
        FOR Index SET to 0; Index less than 100; INCREMENT Index by one each time through the loop
	  PRINT Index plus 1
	END LOOP
      END FUNCTION

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

   A: FUNCTION findEntry(name)
        SET phoneBook equal to an object that is POPULATED with objects that each have Names and Numbers
        LET phoneBookMap equal a NEW instance of Map which includes the entries in phoneBook
        RETURN the Number associated with the Name that was ENTERED as the GET functions parameter 
      END FUNCTION

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

   A: function findEntry(name) {
        let phoneBook = {  
          Dave: '619-867-5309',
          Jim: '702-555-5555',
          Bill: '817-951-3576'
        };
  
        let phoneBookMap = new Map(Object.entries(phoneBook));
        return phoneBookMap.get(name);                         
      }

      console.log(findEntry('Dave'));    // Test Cases
      console.log(findEntry('Jim'));
      console.log(findEntry('Bill'));
